berpunk 2# Plan for fly lab. Studying the inbreeding of flies and how it affects their health

<Generation 0 started>
4/11
  Flies in vial

7/11
  Removed adult flies and kept the vial of eggs and larvae

13/11
  Dark pupae have started to appear
  Check vials every day eventually until eclosion occurs

20/11 : 1M -- TBD :
  AM -- Check for adult flies and remove them (They are non-virgin)
  PM -- Move flies (virgins) - separate males and females

TBD
  Take five vials and put a female along with a single male into each.
  Collect the virgins and remove adults

TBD
  Record the nuber of pupae produced per pair per day
  Record their mobility using movement assays
  Record the pair's lifespan


# Notation of handwritten notes:
  V = virgin
  NV = non virgin
  G* = generation number
  M = Male
  F = Female
